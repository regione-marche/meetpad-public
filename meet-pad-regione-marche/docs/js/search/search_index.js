Questo comporta che alcune righe hanno un’altezza maggiore rispetto alle altre. L’integrazione di altre librerie per la gestione delle tabelle potrebbe essere impattante e soprattutto non risolverebbe il problema. Un’altra alternativa è quella di troncare i testi lunghi (mantenendo un’altezza fissa delle righe della tabella) ed aggiungere un title ben visibile al passaggio del mouse (vediamo se la soluzione attuale soddisfa il cliente).\nAdeguate le dimensioni dei campi in base ai lunghi testi, migliorando leggibilità ed usabilità\nMessaggio nessuna conferenza: modificato \"Nessuna conferenza trovata\" in \"Nella propria scrivania non è ancora presente nessuna conferenza\"\nImpostati gli stessi permessi del Responsabile al Creatore\n\nRemoved\n\nTolte dalla tabella le due colonne relative a \"PEC\"

NB.\nComandi NPM\nSul file package.json sono definiti gli script per la gestione del ciclio di vita del software in funzione degli ambienti/branch:\n\nsviluppo\nrilascio\ndistribuzione\ngenerazione documentazione navigabile.\n\nGli script per eseguire il server di sviluppo in locale e per eseguire il rilascio di una nuova versione hanno un controllo angular envinronment/branch, configurabile; questo è utile ad evitare casi non reali o inconsistenti (es: run suap env on marche-develop/marche-staging branch or run local env on marche-staging/lazio-develop branch).\nDevelopment server\nSuddivisione per ambienti (npm run può essere sostituito da yarn se installato):\n\nnpm run serve: comando per avviare l'ambiente di sviluppo in locale\nnpm run release-distribute:env: comando per rilasciare e distribuire l'applicazione sui vari ambienti in base al valore di env:\ndev\nstaging\ntest\npre-prod\n\n\n\nDeprecati:\n\nnpm run mocks: comando per avviare l server locale che fornisce i mocks delle api\n\nSul file scripts/serve/conf.ts è possibile configurare nuovi branch da eseguire su determinati ambienti.\nRelease\nI rilasci vengono eseguiti grazie al pacchetto npm release-it il quale automatizza alcuni task:\n\ngestione della versione da rilasciare\ncommitb\ntag\npush\n\nTask configurabili da scripts/release/index.ts.\nDistribute\nI rilasci vengono eseguiti grazie al pacchetto npm mobile-app-distribution il quale automatizza alcuni task:\n\nbuild\naggiornamento automatico della versione sul footer dell'app e sulla console\ndeploy sul server\n\nTask configurabili da scripts/distribute/index.ts.\nLe configurazioni di build e di deploy sono presenti nella cartella scripts/distribute/environments.\nGenerazione documentazione\nE' presente la dipendenza di sviluppo @compodoc/compodoc per generare la documentazione\ndel sorgente come sito navigabile.\nComandi:\n\nnpm run docs:build: crea la documentazione all'interno della cartella doc\nnpm run docs:serve: crea la documentazione e il server per navigarla in locale http://127.0.0.1:8080/\nnpm run docs:watch: come il comando precedente con l'opzione watch (watch reload)\n\nConvenzioni\nVersioning\nIl pacchetto release-it ad ogni rilascio, attraverso i comandi visti sopra, mostra nella CLI possibili versioni da rilasciare che il programmatore può scegliere: questo progetto usa lo standard Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.\nCommit\nNell'ultimo perdiodo è stata adottata la convenzione per i messaggi di commit i modo da avere un semplificazione nella manutenzione del progetto (la convenzione sarebbe utile per automatizzare la generazione dei changelog per ogni versione; attualmente non è presente questo automatismo).\nI rifermimenti per le convenzioni sono:\n\nConventional Commits\nAngular JS Allowed Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results
